<p>A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.</p>
<h4>Types of File Path :&#8594</h4>

<h3>Absolute File Path &#8594;</h3>
<p>An Absolute Path is nothing but a full <b>URL</b> to a file.</p>
<p>Example: When we use image tag.
    <br> we put full address URL of that particular image(pick from sites) </p>
<p><b>&lt;img</b> src = "URL" alt="Alternative name" &gt;</p>

<h3>Relative File Path &#8594;</h3>
<p>A relative file path points to a file relative to the current page.</p>
<p>Example 1 : the file path points to a file in the images folder located at the root of the current web:</p>
<img src="Screenshot%202025-09-14%20191608.png" alt="Code" width="400px">
<p>Example 2: the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the current folder:</p>
<img src="Screenshot%202025-09-14%20191938.png" alt="Code" width="400px">
<p>Example 3: the file path points to a file in the images folder located in the folder one level up from the current folder:</p>
<img src="Screenshot%202025-09-14%20192125.png" alt="Code" width="400px">
